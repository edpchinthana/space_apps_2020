        <h2>What is deforestation</h2>
        The clearing of tropical forests across the Earth has been occurring on a large-scale basis for many centuries.
        This process is known as deforestation. <br>
        Forests are an important and common feature of the Earth’s land cover, covering 31 percent of the total land
        surface. Tropical forests of all varieties are disappearing rapidly by human activity. Humans clear the natural
        landscape to make room for farms and pastures, to harvest timber, pulp, and to build roads and houses. Other
        causes of deforestation may include drought, forest fires, and climate change. Although deforestation meets some
        human needs, it also causes major problems, including social conflict, the extinction of plants and animals, and
        climate change. <br>
        Greatly accelerated by human activities since 1960, deforestation has been negatively affecting. The UN’s Food
        and Agriculture Organization estimates the annual rate of deforestation to be around 1.3 million km2 per decade.
        The loss of tropical rain forests is more dangerous than the destruction of beautiful areas. If the current rate
        of deforestation continues, the world's rain forests will vanish within 100 years causing unknown effects on the
        global climate and eliminating the majority of plant and animal species on the planet. so, our world going to be
        dying earth. <br>

        The removal of trees without sufficient reforestation has resulted in habitat damage, biodiversity loss, and
        aridity. It has adverse impacts on the biosequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide.
        <br>
        Deforested regions typically incur significant adverse soil erosion and frequently degrade into wasteland.
        Disregard of ascribed value, lax forest management, and deficient environmental laws are some of the factors
        that lead to large-scale deforestation.
        <br>
        Deforestation causes extinction, changes to climatic conditions, desertification, and displacement of
        populations, as observed by current conditions and in the past through the fossil record.
        <br>
        More than half of all plant and land animal species in the world live in tropical forests. Between 2000 and
        2012, 2.3 million square kilometers (890,000 sq mi) of forests around the world were cut down. As a result of
        deforestation, only 6.2 million square kilometers (2.4 million square miles) remain of the original 16 million
        square kilometers (6 million square miles) of forest that formerly covered the Earth. An area the size of a
        football pitch is cleared from the Amazon rainforest every minute, with 136 million acres (55 million hectares)
        of rainforest cleared for animal agriculture overall
